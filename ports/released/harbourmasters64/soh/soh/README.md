## Information
Ship of Harkinian was built from GitHub Actions at the [HM64 Autobuild Factory](https://github.com/JeodC/hm64-builder).

## Compatibility
TrimUI devices have a render bug where the PVR driver doesn't support NPOT (non-power-of-two) textures and therefore won't render them. The game is still playable, but several textures will be invisible.

## Installation
You need to provide your own roms. See the [Shipwright](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Shipwright/blob/develop/docs/supportedHashes.json) repository for a list of supported rom hashes. Gather your roms and put them in the `ports/soh/baseroms` folder. 

Start the port, and on first run, your .o2r files will be generated from the roms you provide. Note that only one `oot.o2r` and `oot-mq.o2r` will be made--if you provide more than one rom per game, strange things may occur. You *can* use pregenerated `.o2r` files from elsewhere, but you may experience crashes.

Texture pack files and mods can be added to the `ports/soh/mods` folder. 

Logs are recorded automatically as `ports/soh/log.txt` and `ports/soh/tools/otrlog.txt`. Please provide a log if you report an issue. HarbourMasters is not affiliated with PortMaster or RHH-Ports and this distribution is not officially supported by them. *Please report an issue to the RHH-Ports repository before going to HarbourMasters!*

## Menu Navigation
Ship of Harkinian has built-in controller navigation for the imgui menu. Press `SELECT` to open the menu and use the `D-PAD` to choose a submenu, then press `A` to switch focus to it. Press `B` to back out of a submenu.

## Default Gameplay Controls
The port uses SDL controller mapping and controls can be remapped from the imgui menu. For devices without a right analog stick, the gptk file allows for the `HOTKEY + ABXY` button combo to use the C-Buttons.

## Mods
You can find a ton of mods at [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/games/16121?_aFilters%5BGeneric_Name%5D=contains%2C3ds&_sSort=Generic_MostDownloaded).  

## Anchor
This version of Ship of Harkinian is a nightly build with Anchor support. You can modify your name and room id in the launchscript, and then connect to Anchor from the imgui menu. In the global public room, you can see other players as you play through independent save files. If you create your own room, you can play cooperatively.

Anchor is a largely untested and undocumented feature, at least from the port's perspective. I welcome any and all documentation for using Anchor to its fullest extent.
