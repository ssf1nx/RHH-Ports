# Dokimon Quest

## Installation
This port comes with the demo! You can try the game and play up until you're required to leave the first town.

To use the full version, buy the game on Steam or Itch.io and copy all the data to `ports/dokimon/assets`. On first run the game will be patched. If there is an update to the game simply copy the new data to `ports/dokimon/assets` and the patcher will run again.

## Using DLC

GMLoader-Next correctly claims that we do not have access to Steam and can't verify DLC licensure. If you own the Dokimon DLC content, you can transfer your save back to a PC or Steam Deck and begin the DLC. Once you get to the new area, you can save and transfer your save back to continue.

## Runtimes

This port requires the following runtimes in `PortMaster/libs`:

- **GMToolkit** — [gmtoolkit.squashfs](https://github.com/JeodC/RHH-Ports/raw/main/runtimes/gmtoolkit.squashfs)
- **GMLoader-Next** — [gmloadernext.squashfs](https://github.com/JeodC/RHH-Ports/raw/main/runtimes/gmloadernext.squashfs)

[Pharos](https://github.com/JeodC/RHH-Ports/releases/download/ports-latest/pharos.zip) will fetch these automatically when installing the port. Otherwise download them manually from the [runtimes folder](https://github.com/JeodC/RHH-Ports/tree/main/runtimes) and drop them in `PortMaster/libs`.
