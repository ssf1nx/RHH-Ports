# Building RSDKv4 for this port

The shipped `RSDKv4` binary is built with Plus disabled. This guide covers rebuilding from source if you want to enable Plus-mode characters (Amy, Knuckles & Tails, etc.).

## What the shipped binary uses

| Option | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `RETRO_REVISION` | `3` | Universal binary; runtime detects Origins vs mobile data |
| `RETRO_USE_HW_RENDER` | `OFF` | Menu Recreation mod supplies a 2D menu; no GL required |
| `RETRO_DISABLE_PLUS` | `ON` | Four-character classic set (Sonic / Tails / Knuckles / Sonic & Tails) |

The build runs inside an aarch64 Debian chroot (or WSL2 equivalent).
Build automation lives in `buildtools/sonic/rsdkv4/` in the RHH-Ports repo.

## Enabling Plus characters (Amy, extra sidekicks)

This adds the Anniversary-mode roster: `SONIC AND TAILS`,
`KNUCKLES AND TAILS`, `AMY`, `AMY AND TAILS`.

1. Clone the upstream decomp:
   ```
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv4-Decompilation.git
   cd RSDKv4-Decompilation
   ```
2. Configure with Plus enabled:
   ```
   cmake -B build \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
     -DRETRO_REVISION=3 \
     -DRETRO_USE_HW_RENDER=OFF \
     -DRETRO_DISABLE_PLUS=ON \
     -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-pthread"
   cmake --build build --config Release -j$(nproc)
   ```
3. Copy `build/RSDKv4` into `ports/sonic.1/`, replacing the shipped binary. The port's patchscript already expands `Data/Game/GameConfig.bin` to the full seven-slot Plus roster (SONIC, TAILS, KNUCKLES, SONIC AND TAILS, KNUCKLES AND TAILS, AMY, AMY AND TAILS) at extraction time, so Amy shows up correctly in the dev menu as soon as you boot the Plus-enabled binary. No RetroED work needed.
