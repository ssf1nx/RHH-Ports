## Notes

Side Stories is an auto-text game, unlike other visual key novels. It is also experimental and may have issues.


## Runtimes

This port requires the following runtimes in `PortMaster/libs`:

- **RLVM** — [rlvm.squashfs](https://github.com/JeodC/RHH-Ports/raw/main/runtimes/rlvm.squashfs)

[Pharos](https://github.com/JeodC/RHH-Ports/releases/download/ports-latest/pharos.zip) will fetch these automatically when installing the port. Otherwise download them manually from the [runtimes folder](https://github.com/JeodC/RHH-Ports/tree/main/runtimes) and drop them in `PortMaster/libs`.
